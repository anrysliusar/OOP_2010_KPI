# OOP_2020_KPI
Lab works from the OOP course

* Lab 1 - Calculation of numbers by the formula 

* Lab 2 - Operations with matrices

* Lab 3 - Finding the longest palindrome

* Lab 4 - A class with an executable method is created, where an array of objects of the cosmetics class is created, containing 5 fields. Next, the array is sorted by one of the fields in ascending order and in the other in descending order using standard sorting tools.

* Lab 5 - Modified the Lab 3 as follows: for letters, words, sentences, punctuation and text created separate classes. A word should consist of an array of letters, a sentence of an array of words and punctuation, a text of an array of sentences. Replaced the sequence of tabs and spaces with one space.

* Lab 6 - The playroom for children of different ages was implemented as follows: the number of toys should be set within the allocated amount of money, there should be toys for different age groups: small, medium and large cars, dolls, balls, cubes. Toys are sorted in the room in ascending order. You can also find a toy in the room that corresponds to a certain price range. Inheritance and polymorphism were used.

* Lab 7 - A class describing a typed collection was created (the collection type is a generalized class from Lab 6), which is a Set interface and has a given internal structure of a double-linked list. All interface methods are implemented, and 3 constructors are created (1 - empty, 2 - in which 1 object of the generalized class is transferred, 3 - in which the standard collection of objects is transferred).
